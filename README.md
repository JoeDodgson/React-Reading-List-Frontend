## Description
This is a reading list application, created using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js), deployed to Heroku. There are two pages: Search and Saved. On the 'Search' page you can search for a book - this sends a request to the Google Books API and displays a list of results. You can click 'Add' to add a book to your saved list. On the 'Saved' page you can view all saved books and remove them from your list.

## Installation

No installation required.
